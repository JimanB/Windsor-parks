            <!--main park description-->
            <p>Coventry Gardens is a jewel along Windsor's riverfront, offering breathtaking views of the Detroit
                skyline. Its most famous feature is the Charlie Brooks Memorial Peace Fountain, a spectacular floating
                fountain that delights visitors with its dazzling light and water displays. The park is a
                tranquil oasis, with beautifully manicured gardens, walking paths, and plenty of seating areas to relax
                and enjoy the scenery. It's a popular spot for leisurely strolls, photography, and quiet contemplation.
                The gardens are meticulously maintained, showcasing a vibrant array of flowers and plants throughout the
                seasons. As a cornerstone of the Peace Trail, Coventry Gardens serves as a symbol of the enduring
                friendship between Canada and the United States, making it a significant and beloved landmark in the
                city.</p>
