            <!--detailed park description-->
            <p>Jackson Park is one of Windsor's most prestigious and historically significant parks. It is renowned for
                its stunning formal gardens, including the Queen Elizabeth II Sunken Garden and a breathtaking rose
                garden featuring over 12,000 rose bushes. The park serves as a tribute to Canada's veterans, with
                prominent memorials such as a World War II Lancaster Bomber and a Spitfire replica, making it a place of
                both beauty and remembrance. Its vast network of paths is perfect for walking and cycling, leading
                visitors through meticulously landscaped grounds. In the winter, the park transforms into a magical
                wonderland with the "Bright Lights Windsor" festival, attracting thousands with its spectacular holiday
                light displays. Jackson Park is a hub of community activity, hosting events and celebrations year-round,
                and stands as a testament to horticultural excellence and civic pride.</p>
